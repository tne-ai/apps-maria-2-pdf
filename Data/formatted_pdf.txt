Over the next few years, this figure experienced a steady increase, reaching about $308.71 billion by 2023. This growth represents a significant increase of approximately 26.4% over the five-year period. Despite a slight decrease in population from 3,330,458 in 2019 to 3,252,468 in 2023, the GRP per capita saw a substantial rise. Starting at $73,346.92 in 2019, the GRP per capita climbed to $94,915.87 in 2023, marking an impressive growth of approximately 29.4%. This increase in GRP per capita suggests that the economic output per individual in San Diego County has improved considerably, indicating enhanced productivity and economic conditions in the region.",
