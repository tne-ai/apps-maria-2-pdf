    "details": "The analysis is based on data from the 'sec1-2_San Diego County_per_capita_grp_data.csv' file, which includes total GRP, population, and GRP per capita for San Diego County. The total GRP increased by 26.4% from 2019 to 2023, while the GRP per capita rose by 29.4%. The population saw a slight decrease, particularly in 2020, with a minor recovery in 2022. The calculations for GRP per capita were derived by dividing the total GRP by the population for each year.",
    "recommendations": "Consider strategies to sustain economic growth and address population decline, such as attracting new residents or enhancing workforce development programs.",
    "request_and_response_issues": "The data provided is comprehensive for the analysis of GRP trends. However, additional context on factors influencing population changes could enhance understanding of demographic impacts on economic growth."
