 'tableData': '<Place the given markdown table here as is. Do not add any extra formatting, like ``` or anything of that sort. If multiple tables, ONLY put one here. The frontend that you input to can only support a single table. Pick the most important one. If no markdown tables but some type of other data are provided, format it into a markdown table without any special text attributes (bold, italics, etc.) - it must render in the downstream system.>'. Also, when making a new row, dont create empty columns on each side (example: dont do |\n|).
 'chartData': '<If a chart is requested or can convey the data requested by the response clearly, include a chart specification here using valid json parseable by the chart.js library, including the data to be presented in the chart. This data should just be a representation of the given markdown table. Be sure to title the chart. You are only permitted to use single colors, and must specify this color explicitly in the chart.js. If the label is more than 12 characters, abbreviate it in a semantically meaningful way - for example, "handbag crossbody bag style 2043" just becomes "style 2043". Also explicitly exclude legends from the charts.>',
